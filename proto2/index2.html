                <p><strong>Hollis Brunt</strong> has spent over a decade working across many cultural
                    sectors including film and television, theatre, and live events. Through their developed craft and
                    passion for their work they have become known for curating experiences that are thoughtful, unique,
                    and inclusive.</p>

                <p>As an Event Producer, Hollis has worked internationally from North America to Australia. Their
                    portfolio spans across multiple markets with a heavy focus on community-rooted events that celebrate
                    local creativity in all its forms and family-friendly experiences that are fun for kids, parents,
                    and everyone in between.</p>

                <p>They bring that same energy, heart, and drive into music and live performance development by opening
                    doors for emerging and established 2SLGBTQIA+ artists by advocating for artists at every step of
                    their career. Hollis ensures their clients receive fair and respectful treatment across the
                    industry, as well as connecting them with talent buyers and industry professionals across the globe
                    to expand their voice.</p>

                <p>They are currently building <strong>Misfit Live</strong>, a new agency within Misfit Music Management
                    - a live performance and career-building arm rooted in championing 2SLGBTQIA+ artists across North
                    America and beyond. Launching in 2026, Misfit Live is dedicated to expanding stages and spotlights
                    for queer voices and their allies: from concerts and tours to speaking engagements, workshops, and
                    on-screen opportunities.</p>

                <p>Guided by collaboration, care, and a commitment to uplifting underrepresented voices, Hollis
                    continues to shape culture and connection one unforgettable event at a time. If this resonates, it's
                    worth a conversation. Contact Hollis with the links below.</p>
